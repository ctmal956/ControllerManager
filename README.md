Controller Manager AddIn for Vixen 2.1

This is a simple addin for Vixen 2.x that will help in making quick changes to channel outputs.  It allows you to add controllers that work in a Renard style and swap outputs amoung them.

Additionally, once all controllers are set up, it has the ability to create labels that can be put inside the controllers.
