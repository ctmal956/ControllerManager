                    To add a controller, change the channel count in "Channels" to the number of channels your controller has and press the + button.  The controller will take the next available outputs that are not already assigned to a controller.

                <Paragraph>
                    To reorder channels within a controller, right click the controller to display its details in the right pane.  In the right pane, left click the channel you want to move and drag it over the channel you want to swap it with.  When you release the left mouse button the two channels will swap.
Note:  This changes the output channels.  In other words, this will affect how the channels are output to your display.  Its very useful to quickly change an output if, for example, a triac goes bad.
